# Problem Solving

Welcome üòÑ to the Problem Solving Repository! This repository is dedicated to solving programming problems and enhancing your problem-solving skills. Here, you will find a collection of solved problems, organized by different levels of difficulty.

In this repository, you will find a curated selection of programming problems covering various topics and difficulty levels. Each problem is accompanied by a detailed solution explanation and code implementation in a specific programming language(Now Just Javascript üòÖüòÅ).

## The Approach That I Will Following In Problem Solving

When it comes to problem-solving in programming, it's essential to follow a structured and systematic approach. Here's my approach to tackle programming problems effectively :

1. **_Understand the Problem_** : Read and understand the problem statement carefully. Identify the inputs, expected outputs, and any constraints or edge cases.

2. **_Break Down the Problem_** : Divide the problem into smaller subproblems or tasks. This helps in understanding the problem better and allows for a more manageable approach.

3. **_Plan the Solution_** : Determine the high-level strategy or algorithm to solve the problem.

4. **_Write Pseudocode_** : Before diving into actual coding, write pseudocode that outlines the steps of the solution. Pseudocode helps in organizing your thoughts and clarifying the logic of the solution.

5. **_Implement the Solution_** : Write the actual code based on the pseudocode. Follow best coding practices and conventions to ensure readability and maintainability of the code.

6. **_Test the Solution_** : Create test cases to verify the correctness of your solution. Test the code with both normal and edge cases to ensure it handles all possible scenarios.

7. **_Analyze and Optimize_** : Evaluate the efficiency of your solution. Look for areas where the code can be optimized or improved. Consider time complexity, space complexity, and any potential bottlenecks.

8. **_Document the Solution_** : Add comments and documentation to your code, explaining the purpose of each function, logic, and any important considerations. Good documentation helps in understanding and maintaining the code in the future.

9. **_Review and Learn_** : Reflect on the problem-solving process and the lessons learned. Review the code, analyze any challenges faced, and seek feedback from peers or mentors. This continuous learning process improves your problem-solving skills over time.
