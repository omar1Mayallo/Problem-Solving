# SQL Learning Journey

I am currently learning SQL through the

- [SQL and PostgreSQL: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-and-postgresql/)

- [SQL Cookbook, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-cookbook-2nd/9781492077435/) as a reference guide.

As part of my practice, I am actively solving SQL problems on platforms like HackerRank. You can find my HackerRank profile [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/omar1_mayallo4?hr_r=1).

I believe that combining course-based learning with practical problem-solving exercises will enhance my SQL skills and reinforce my understanding of the concepts.
